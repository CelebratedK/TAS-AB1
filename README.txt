Hiya, this is our Git for the data analysis file.

Git is a way to collaborate on code with version control;
if someone messes up code, we can revert back to a previous working version

The first step is to create a github account, then send it on whatsapp
(I'll add you as a contributor)

To edit or add new files, go in Repository --> View in explorer
Then you can create new files, delete files or modify existing ones.

After you are done, you can commit your changes with a new version description.
Just make sure that you don't have two people editing the same file at the same time,
otherwise we end up with two up-to date versions

*Please don't just write a number, I used to do that and it's not clear what each version is
